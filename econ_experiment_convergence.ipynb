      "It has instant feedback\n",
      "I think it give me more clarity so I can take a guess how many efforts do my teammates contribute.\n",
      "There was no real benefit to option 2, as everything it provided was available in option 1. 1 was more explicit in its presentation of data.\n",
      "After each round, we are able to see the total effort units that are contributed \n",
      "It was made clear\n",
      "It allowed for transparency between team members which would affect my decision to contribute or not contribute.\n",
      "Option 2 had a single point of failure in trust, that if the milestone fails to be reached this or if someone contributes too much, this could lead others to not contribute after round 1. Whereby option 1 provided more glandular data, allowing me to fine tune my contribution to risk ratio much better. My strategy for option 1 was more psychological than game theory in nature, trying to build trust with other participants, before scaling down and pulling the plug depending on cooperation of other actors.\n",
      "It gave me more clarity\n",

      "It is more clear.\n",

      "I think the feedback option is much clearer than the second feedback option as it provides me with the exact amount of the total effort units so that I am able to make my decisions based on the total amount already contributed.\n",
      "I think Feedback option 1 is clearer and I can know the certain number of effort units that my team contributes to the joint project in each round. It helps me to make a decision rapidly in the next round.\n",

      "easy to see\n",
      "it gives me a better look at the progress\n",

      "I think it will be easier to check the results of our group because it shows the exact number. Milestone will make me confuse how large the gap will be to reach the next milestone.\n",

      "I can analysis my team member contribution to the join project. I will always need to contribute less than them so that I can maximises my benefit. Furthermore, if using the Feedback Option 1, as the first milestone only started at 15, it might causes lose confidence in my team members if the milestone is not hit and I will also be hesitated to contribute to the join project. Feedback Option 1 will causes team member losing trust in each other and will not contribute any thing at all for the join proejct. Thus, I weakly preferred Option 2. \n",

      "By choosing option2 I can clearly see the contribution of my teammates and of course someone didn't make any contributions at all.\n",
      "It clearly stated the exact amount of contribution from the team to joint project in each round which made me take better decisions.\n",
      "I think know the number of the team contributes to the joint project help me to make wise decisions.\n",
      "because you were more able to accurately see how much your team has contributed instead of guessing like with option one\n",
      "I was to see the exact number of points being contributed and make my decisions based on the average number of points contributed by my teammates. I would refer contributing the same number of points as the average number of points being contributed in the previous round.\n",

      "it allowed me to make better decisions around how much i wanted to contribute as i could see exactly how much my teammates were contributing\n",
      "I believe that the pros of choosing this includes being able to react appropriately immediately, and there are perhaps no down side to choosing this over Option 2. I also believe that majority will pick this.\n",
      "my preference was a weak preference. however, I chose feedback 1 to see how many units were contributed by my team members in total, in order to have an idea about their strategies.\n",
      "It would be the best to know the exact total amount rather than just when reaching a milestone.\n",
      "It provides more information for me so that I can use my grim trigger strategy if the total contribution does not reach my expected value.\n",
      "Feedback option 1 provided clear details of how the members contributed to each round which allowed me to make an informed decision towards making my own contributions in the next round.\n",
      "I can receive more information in Option 1 than 2\n",
      "It is because we can know the current position\n",
      "I think knowing the process of contribution will definetly change my decision on makeing effort in next round. I have a better map on how my team contribute from opinion 1 than opinion 2.\n",
      "Clearer visualisation of the teammates' investment choices\n",
      "I can track the number precisely and make decisions in the best interest of me. In another word, it is not that risky. \n",

      "I can able to see what are the group efforts what how much do I need to contribute in order to get the project done.\n",
      "Just wanted to see progress\n",
      "I choose option 2 because it allows me to weight the risk of investing into the joint project by calculating other's total response.  Basically making sure I wouldn't end up with the short-end of the stick.\n",
      "I don't want risk\n",
      "It was more transparent\n",
      "I want to let others know my decision, I have all in for the first round and anticipated that after other participant saw my intention, they will do the same thing.\n",
      "I prefer to see the exact contributions from the whole team to guide my decision\n",
      "The reason that I voted for option 2 because I can make sure I could know all the progress of the milestone each round. Let's say if at the end all 6 rounds the group contribution is less than 15 for option 1, I couldn't see any progress of the milestone while for option 2, I could adjust my contribution of later rounds base on the contribution of my groupmates in the previous rounds.\n",
      "It seemed more accurate and it was also easy to calculate the contributions of other group members.\n",
      "It was easier to understand what direction my team was going for and in order to re-evaluate my decision making easier.\n",
      "More information means better decision making.\n",
      "I like precision and I am very much a logical thinker and I like to know precisely what I am getting myself into and the exact data of that.\n",
      "Feedback option 2 allows me to assess the behaviour of my team mates. This will allow me to adjust my action accordingly.\n",
      "I would like to know specifically how many effort units have been made to the project so far, instead of only knowing whether we have hit the milestone or not. This is because I do not like ambiguity, and if I need to decide on my contributions, I want to know how much risk I am at clearly. Only knowing the milestone does not give as much as clarity as compared to if I know the specific number.\n",
      "I can see how many effort units my team member have contributed in each round and make the decision based on their.\n",
      "If the most beneficial outcome is determined by cooperation, being able to see and gage the cooperation is essential \n",
      "It is assumed that more detailed information allows for better decision making, which I agree with. Knowing the precise amount of effort units contributed allows me to better understand what kind of decisions are being made by the other members, compared to a milestone gauge that may not increase at all for 2 or more rounds at a time. I would much rather know more to better judge the decisions I will make.\n",

      "BY NOT KNOWING THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER MEMBERS, IT WOULD NOT AFFECT MY DECISION MAKING PROCESS \n",

      "Option2 gives a better sense about the process so far and the stage we are at, rather than Option 1 which is too precise that makes me want to calculate the average contribution. Then I would compare the average with my efforts and feels like I'm contributing too much or why others so selfish. Actually it did happen when I gave 5 efforts in the first round and found the average is 1. I think I've already send a positive signal that I'm willing to contribute towards the maximum overall welfare, 90. However the results in round 2 is still dispointing. Then I just gave up, in the last 3 round everyone gave 0 efforts.  So the point is the Option 2 cuts the process nicely into 6 stages and make people feel aimful to complete each of them during each round.\n",
      "So I could obscure how much money was being invested and so I could get away with giving out less. As it turns out, everyone else had the same idea.\n",
      "i knew i was going to contribute 0 each round to give me the highest chance of getting the most profit out of it. if i chose feedback option 1, and my other teammates saw that the progress bar was either moving slowly/slower/or none at all, they would start to do the same ;)  providing somewhat of an anonymity allowed me to be super greedy  \n",
      "In Option 2, people would assume higher number of effort units put into joint project. Therefore, to maximize the token profit, the best choice would be to pick Option 2 and not put effort units for yourself at all. \n",
      "Unspesific information makes people guessing and take more risks.\n",
      "people would less likely to know what others contributed\n",
      "I aim for milestones.\n",
      "I was determined to contribute 0 effort units for this part of the experiment regardless of the feedback options, so I would have liked my team to have less information. This is because I assumed potential risk takers may be more unwilling to take risks if they receive extra information about their teammates not contributing. My goal is to maximise my own winnings.\n",
      "If I voted for option 2, then the others would know how much I was contributing and contribute less in subsequent rounds. Because I understood the math behind, I could tell that I would make less if contributed 30 and others contributed 0. So I decided to contribute 30, and make the most even if no one else contributed\n",
      "People can't see each other's exact contributions, thus may be more likely to believe that others have good intentions and willingness to invest, thereby contribute more themselves\n",
      "Prisoner's Dilemma would apply to all people taking the experiment. Hence, it is better if there is ambiguity in the contribution I make so that others can make more and I can profit from that.\n",
      "The other two team members might be confident about the progress as I would choose to invest a large amount in the first round and convince them that we are working together to make total contribution greater. However, I would stop making large contribution from round 2 and keep most of my contribution left.\n",
      "at the robot test, I found robot usually contribute more money in the ground. But I don't think the real human will do as robots. so I want to choose the option I to keep some distance with them. But if they choose feedback 2, maybe they are a risk prefer, so I can make more contribution if they choose 2.\n",
      "We cannot know clearly what the others participants invest for the project\n",
      "like to take risk, it seems much more possibilities to win and loss compared to the second option\n",
      "I think it will be easier to get my teammates to contribute more money since I do not intend to contribute much.\n",
      "Because somehow I think people will have incentive to reach a milestone, while option 2 they could know exactly contributions of others so they might not adjust accordingly\n",
      "My strategy was investing a lot at first, and few then. So, I want to hide my strategy more.\n",
      "For round two I decided to go with the strategy of all in my 30 effort units in the first round, therefore with feedback option 2, it will immediately reach the first two milestone, and motivate my team members to contribute more of their effort unit, as the most optimal solution to this experiment is for everyone to all in. \n",
      "Less easy to determine how much your team members have contributed.\n",
      "It is more fun, and encourages group to invest more, not knowing the exact value.\n",
      "Since all of the members only can see the milestone achievement, it could be a motivation for all of the members to participate more on the project.\n",
      "I thought it would be more likely under option 2 that my team mates would continue puting in a large amount of effort with miles stones. \n",

Hence, it can somewhat weed out those who do not contribute anything at all. Thought, option 2 leads to potentially more earnings, I like to know how much effort personally I should put in the ensure equal success for everyone, but at the same time, see how much everyone else is doing in reaching the milestone.\n",
